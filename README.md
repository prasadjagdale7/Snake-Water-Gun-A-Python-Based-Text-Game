# Snake-Water-Gun:A Python Based TextGame                                                                                                               
Created a basic text-based game using Python, inspired by the classic "Snake-Water-Gun" game.
Used random choice for the computer's move to make the game unpredictable.
Handled user input by allowing players to choose "Snake," "Water," or "Gun."
Implemented logic to determine the winner of each round (player, computer, or draw).
Included input validation to manage incorrect entries and prompt the user to try again.
Practiced key Python concepts like dictionaries, conditionals, and loops.
